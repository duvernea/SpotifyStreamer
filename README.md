#Spotify Streamer 
## Projects 1 & 2 of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree

Built an app, optimized for phone and tablet, that allows user to search by aritist on Spotify. The top 10 tracks from Artist are displayed in a scrolling list complete with album art. Tracks can be streamed via the player in the app, which utilizes Android's mediaplayer API.

Additional features implemented include:

* Notifications with media controls from lockscreen and drawer.
* Sharing functionality
* Settings menu to select Country and turn Notifications on/off
* "Now Playing" - instant access to the player from anywhere in the app

No Spotify account is necessary for using this app, as the streamed samples are only partial versions of full track.
